Basic Details
Team Name: Useless Innovator
Team Lead: Andrea Rose Joseph - Vishwajyothi College of Engineering & Technology
Project Description
The Irritating Text-to-Speech Converter is a web app that transforms any given text into speech in the most annoying way possible. Users can choose an irritation level, and the app will distort the text using techniques like pitch shifts, speed variations, robotic effects, and more. The result? An unbearable listening experience that guarantees frustration and fun!
The Problem (That Doesn't Exist)
People have grown far too comfortable with normal, pleasant text-to-speech apps. We need a solution that ensures no one can listen to speech without getting completely frustrated.
The Solution (That Nobody Asked For)
The Irritating Text-to-Speech Converter takes any text and turns it into an obnoxious, maddening experience by applying pitch changes, fluctuating speeds, word scrambling, random pauses, and robotic noises. It's the perfect app to add some chaos to your life!
